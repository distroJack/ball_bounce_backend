# Ball Bounce Backend

Ideally this backend would be of near 0 cost and allow both players seamless gameplay.

I fear that in its current form and with my technical experience, the end product will be too expensive and slow.

Do a write up on the code that's present for future Jack.

The expectation is that once you learn to do just in time instance spin up, 
then you can come back and make a super fast, super cheap implementation that uses elasticache instead of dynamoDb.
